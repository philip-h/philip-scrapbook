"<p>There is no doubt that the transition from adolescence to adulthood is taking longer on average than in the past. In the article <em>Changes in the transition to adulthood in the UK and Canada: the role of agency in emerging adulthood</em> by James Côté and John M. Bynner (2008), the authors present arguments stating the reason for this prolonged transition is not a freely chosen postponement of commitments characterised by a new conception of development, proposed by Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, rather it is a consequence of social and economic conditions in developed countries, more specifically, in Canada and the UK. This article is persuasive, informative, and therefore successful at explaining some of the reasons for the prolonged transition into adulthood because of the professional tone and overall empathy of the authors and the abundant use of statistics throughout the article.</p><p>The professional tone of this article can be seen in the ways Côté and Bynner empathize with Arnett. The authors state through this article that they are voicing their \"scepticism about the utility and applicability of the EA (Emerging Adulthood)\" (Côté and Bynner, 252), however are empathetic and understanding to those who have adopted this EA model because those who adopt the EA model realise \"the transition to adulthood has changed and are looking for a useful metaphor for what is different from the past.\" (Côté and Bynner, 252) This professional tone can also be seen in the ways in which the authors disagree with Arnett, then accompany said disagreements with facts. One opposition that Côté and Bynner have with Arnett's EA model is that it implies that this prolonging of transition into adulthood started only recently. (Côté and Bynner, 253-254) Côté and Bynner state that this prolonging has been \"occurring in much of its present form throughout the latter half of the twentieth century.\" (Côté and Bynner, 254) The two authors then cite two articles written in 1995 stating that the transition time to adulthood is increasing, and has been increasing, followed by one written in 2007 by Warren Clark stating these transitions have been \"'changed or delayed' since 1971\". (Côté and Bynner, 254) Côté and Bynner do an excellent job refuting Arnett's arguments in a professional and empathetic way, thus increasing the persuasiveness of the article.</p><p>The use of statistics in this article reinforces the informative nature of this article. Côté and Bynner argue that the extended transition to adulthood has much to do with the circumstances and experiences of the individual. (Côté and Bynner, 256) Côté and Bynner proceed to support this claim by referring to the series of British cohort studies: the National Survey of Health. Two figures are shown presenting the impact that the academic success of the parents have on the child’s likeliness to achieve a university or college degree and the child's likeliness to experience a temporary suspension from school, respectively. This collected data directly serves to illustrate the ways in which extended transition to adulthood is affected by the circumstances to which the current generation is exposed. Côté and Bynner also state that young people are not choosing to \"evade adult commitments\" but are waiting \"until these commitments can be responsibly made from a position of financial security\" (Côté and Bynner, 259) Once again, this claim is backed up by looking at the average individual annual income in 2004 collected by Statistics Canada in 2006. Upon viewing this data, it can be noted that the average income of those in their early twenties is below the poverty line in a city with a population of 500,000 or more. (Côté and Bynner, 259) Once again, this fact directly serves to defending the argument that young people are subject to their circumstances. Côté and Bynner provide highly relevant and accredited statistics to support their arguments, demonstrating the article is indeed, to a high degree, informative.</p><p>James Côté and John M. Bynner's article <em>Changes in the transition to adulthood in the UK and Canada: the role of agency in emerging adulthood</em> presents many arguments against a new developmental stage called Emerging Adulthood. I believe this article is highly successful at arguing against such a conception due to the professional tone that Côté and Bynner have when opposing Arnett and the informative use of facts and statistics to support their beliefs. This article is well worth the read if you are a young person trying to formulate arguments against older generations about your lack of motivation to start being an adult.</p>"

    "body": "<p>There are many amazing educators in developed countries that want the very best for their students, especially those living in the so-called “rough” neighbourhoods of the city. It is apparent to educators that these students are indeed affected by something, and many believe it to be the rough neighbourhood itself, yet would seldom look for relevant research on the topic. The article <em>Neighbourhood Poverty and Adolescent Development</em> by Velma McBride Murry, Cady Berkel et al. aims to do just that, examine the studies conducted on the effects of neighbourhood poverty on adolescents. This article is effective because it is well organized and it brings relevant issues about the correlation between adolescent development and the environment in which they are raised to light.</p><p>The organization of this article can be seen in its structure. The article mentions six topics that have been studied to be associated with neighbourhood poverty. Each of these topics are addressed in detail per the introduction (Murry et al., 114), and examine the research, where applicable, of both the direct and indirect consequences of these topics. Such topics include adolescent identity development and academic achievement (Murry et al., 114). Furthermore, in each section, the authors swiftly dive into the research for the topics at hand, or boldly claim that research in a particular topic is lacking and should be made a priority among these researchers (Murry et al., 115). This structure, along with the disinclination of the authors to state their opinions on the research, allowing the prevailing knowledge of the topic, or lack thereof, to speak for itself adds to the effectiveness of the article.</p><p>The insight this article provides is unarguably important for all current and aspiring educators. There is a definite stereotype, whether true or not, in the western world that teaching students from poverty stricken areas can prove to be challenging. This article offers insights into the prevailing research depicting the reasons for such difficulties. According to the article, we see that research on the effects of the influence of neighbourhood poverty on adolescents’ academic achievement is uncertain (Murry et al., 117). These facts provide reasons for educators to look for research about the correlation between academic achievement and the neighbourhood in which the adolescents live. One such example is an article by Jean Anyon that examines the classroom experience of students who go to school in poverty stricken areas versus students to attend schools in more wealthy neighbourhoods. This hopeful call to action along with the insight into current research about the connection between poverty and adolescent development emphasize the effectiveness of the article.</p><p><em>Neighbourhood Poverty and Adolescent Development</em> by Murry et al is effective in its attempt to review studies conducted about the interrelationship between adolescent development and neighbourhood poverty. This is due to the article’s structure of review and the insights it provides for educators. This article is an amazing source of knowledge for those aspiring to be teachers.</p><h1 style='text-align: center; margin-top: 100px'>References</h1><p>Anyon, J. (1980).

    "body": "<p>Canadians are often proud of the multicultural country in which they reside; many of us hoping, and some of us believing, that we have all but abolished racism. Mary E. Thomas’ article <em>‘I think it’s just natural’: the spatiality of racial segregation at a US high school</em> is centred around the discourse and actions of high school girls, showing that racism, typically of the form of racial segregation, is present even if it is present in unconscious manners. The article is effective in illustrating the unconscious bias of many through the lens of these girls because of the comparisons made with other prevalent research about segregation of different forms and the raw, recorded discourse these girls have with Thomas.</p> <p>In the introduction, Thomas makes reference to Butler, comparing Butler’s idea of performative gender with that of racism, stating “I understand race to be a performative that ‘does not merely refer, but acts in some way to constitute that which it enunciates.’” (Thomas, 1233) This proves to be effective due to the plethora of comparisons that can be made, throughout history, with racism and sexism. Thomas also makes reference Kobayashi and Peake who “insist that past landscapes established today’s racist normalization (Kobayashi and Peake, 2000)” (Thomas, 1239). This idea is evident though the conversations with Lucinda and Alice, who have normalized acknowledging the racial difference between the ‘black girl’ and the ‘white girl’ (Thomas, 1241), and through the conversation with Joy who does not know why their cafeteria room is segregated during lunch hour (Thomas, 1238). Unconscious segregation can begin to be dealt with only after a conscious effort is made to acknowledge the segregation, a point which Thomas effectively makes through the use of other’s research.</p><p>The impressive influence of this article comes from the recorded discourse that Thomas provides. Through this discourse, we can see students like Joy and Bryana do not even acknowledge the segregation as a racial issue (Thomas, 1237). This contrasts with students like Faith and Kelli who propagate racist images and are vocal about potential violence towards members of the opposite race. (Thomas, 1245). This discourse provides insight into the thoughts and actions of the girls from the US high school. The important discourse here is the unconscious segregation that takes place with students like Joy and Bryana. Blatant racism is easier to deal with by nature of it being obviously wrong.  The idea that unconscious racism proves to be more challenging to address because either one or both of the parties see nothing wrong is a cornerstone of the effectiveness of Thomas’ article.</p><p>As developed nations, the United States and Canada are far from the eradication of racism. Mary E. Thomas’ article <em>‘I think it’s just natural’: the spatiality of racial segregation at a US high school</em> proves the aforementioned statement with remarkable effectiveness though the use of research conducted in similar fields and the use of verbatim conversations with high school girls. I argue that through these girls, we can speak about the many due to the observation about the power past landscapes have on racism made by Kobayashi and Peake. If there is a temptation to argue about the immaturity of these high school girls, Kobayashi and Peake’s statement indicates it was learned. This acknowledgement is important if developing countries want to stand a chance against the ever losing battle of segregation.</p>"
