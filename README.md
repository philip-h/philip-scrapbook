A Blog-ish thing quickly written in VueJS to for reading-response entries for a BEd couse called "Adolescent Development".

Because I know I'll forget:
Ensure @vue/cli and @vue/cli-service are a thing.

Then do

```
npm run serve
```

and voila.

Intended for showcasing on Heroku, but I will probably swtich to Netlify because it's all static after Vue renders it!
